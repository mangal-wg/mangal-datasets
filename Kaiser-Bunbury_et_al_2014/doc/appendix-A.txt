A.1 Plant–pollinator networks 
In total, 97 flower visitor taxa were recorded, of which 14 taxa, belonging to the groups of 
spiders, crickets, true bugs (hemiptera) and ants, were excluded from the networks as they were 
not considered pollinators of the inselberg plants. Pollinators were identified to species level for 
28 taxa (34%) and to morpho-species level for the remaining 55 taxa (66%; hereafter all 
pollinator taxa are referred to as ‘pollinator species’). Morpho-species were not pooled based on 
morphological traits such as size, but they were distinguished at the smallest possible level 
without taxonomic determination and assigned a species code. Flower visitors were recorded as 
pollinators when they touched the sexual parts of flowers. Sampling of interactions was 
conducted by the same three observers throughout the 8-month flowering season and sampling 
was standardized between observers fortnightly. We used equal observation periods for all plant 
species to reduce sampling bias and to collect data on interaction frequency independent of size 
constraints and flower abundance (Ollerton and Cranmer 2002). 
To assess the effect of sampling on network dissimilarities we conducted a rarefaction 
analysis (Hurlbert 1971, Heck et al. 1975). We calculated Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (see Section 
D below for a detailed description on dissimilarity matrices) between rarefied interaction 
matrices sampled at four different proportions (0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2) and compared the resulting 
mean ± 95% CI dissimilarities of the rarefied matrices to the dissimilarity between the original 
matrices. Sampling simulation was carried out with the function rarefmat in R (the code of the 
function is provided as a supplement). Interaction matrices consisted of all plant and animal 
species in rows and columns, respectively. Cells contained a normalized measure of interaction 
frequency, which was rounded up to the next integer to allow for rarefaction. Dissimilarities 
were calculated based on relative frequencies in the rarefied and observed matrices. We ran a 
subsample (N = 86) of all possible pairwise matrix comparisons within and across sites and time 
periods. All comparisons showed similar results: None of the rarefied matrices were significantly 
more or less dissimilar than the observed matrices even at low sampling proportions, and the 
overall differences in dissimilarities between rarefied and observed matrices were relatively 
small (Fig. B4). These findings suggest that the comparison of dissimilarities between interaction 
matrices is robust to sampling effects.

A.2 Plant traits – floral complexity and exotic plants 
To quantify floral complexity, we identified a priori four flower traits to describe a gradient of 
increasing floral restrictiveness and handling complexity: (1) floral symmetry and pollen 
presentation patterns within the flower, (2) flower dimensionality, (3) accessibility of nectar, and 
(4) flower orientation (Table A5). Scores from 0–5 were assigned to each trait reflecting an 
increasing degree of handling complexity, and added up to one single value per plant species, 
reflecting its total floral complexity. Plants with total scores close to 20 were considered 
extremely complex, restricting flower access to a small group of specialized pollinator species. 
In contrast, plants with scores close to 0 presented flowers accessible to a large variety of 
pollinator species. Pollinator species richness decreased significantly with increasing floral 
complexity (Fig. B5; linear regression: R2 = 0.198, df = 36, P = 0.0052). The species included in 
this study were scored independently by three people based on photographs and handling 
experience of the flowers, and the assigned scores differed only minimally in two of 37 plant 
species (scores in Table A3). To assess the influence of the category size on the model fit, we 
conducted the same analysis with five and seven equally-sized categories which generated 
comparable statistical models. The model with five categories (width of categories: 0–3, 4–7, 8– 
11, 12–15, =16 complexity scores) had the better overall fit and we therefore used only the 
model with five categories in the analysis. 
The proportion of exotic flowers in the communities was included as an independent 
predictor variable in our models for two reasons: (1) exotic flowers have been shown to be 
particularly attractive to pollinators as a result of their high energy nectar and attractive flowers 
(e.g., Chittka and Schürkens 2001), and (2) the attractiveness of exotic plants can be unevenly 
distributed within the pollinator community (e.g., exotic pollinators are more frequently attracted 
to exotic plants than native pollinators; Aizen et al. 2008, Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2011). These 
properties of exotic plants are not part of plant abundance and trait variables and thus warrant 
independent inclusion in the model. 
A.3 Pollinator traits – body size 
We used body dimensions of pollinators to define functional groups of pollinator traits. We 
recorded thorax width and total body length of invertebrates, head width and body length 
(without tail) of birds, and head width and snout to vent length of geckos (Table A4) as proxy for 
pollinator functional diversity (Stang et al. 2006). Total body length (head, thorax and abdomen) 
was recorded on straightened insects, and we used calipers to measure body dimensions to the 
nearest 0.1 mm. Thorax width and body length were highly correlated (log-transformed; r = 0.80, 
P . 0.001, N = 83). To determine the optimal number of size classes, we plotted a histogram of 
thorax width (log-transformed) and selected the lowest number of equal size categories which 
created a good fit to the normal distribution. We tested the robustness of the classification by 
running the same analysis with seven, eight and nine categories, both with thorax width and body 
size. All possible combinations generated similar qualitative effects but the best fit showed the 

36 
model with thorax width and eight size classes. Thus, we used eight size classes of pollinator 
functional groups in the analysis. 
A.4 Dissimilarity variables 
We created 48 interaction matrices consisting of 37 plant species in rows and 83 pollinator 
species in columns. Interaction frequency between two mutualistic partners was normalized by 
dividing by total interaction frequency in the network. We computed Bray-Curtis dissimilarity 
values for all pair-wise combinations of the interaction matrices. The output was a 48 × 48 lower 
triangular matrix with cells containing interaction dissimilarities quantifying the degree of 
dissimilarity between every pair of interaction matrices (Dx,y). Following a similar procedure, we 
created dissimilarity matrices for all observed indicator variables. Dissimilarity matrices were 
calculated from the following matrices with 48 networks in rows: Floral and pollinator 
abundance contained plant and animal species, respectively, in columns ordered by decreasing 
relative abundance in each network, independent of species identity, and relative floral 
abundance in cells; floral composition and pollinator composition contained plant and pollinator 
species in columns and sum of floral abundance and mean interaction frequency in cells, 
respectively; the proportion of exotic flowers in each network contained the proportion of exotic 
flowers in communities +1 in one row—1 was added to avoid zero in the denominator when 
calculating dissimilarities of communities without exotic flowering plants; and plant and 
pollinator trait matrices had categories in columns and the sum of floral abundance and mean 
interaction frequency in cells, respectively. Bray-Curtis dissimilarities index ranges from 1 to 0, 
where values close to 0 are relatively similar and values close to 1 are highly dissimilar. 
All variables except time of year and geographic location were normalized prior to 
calculating dissimilarity values by dividing each cell by the marginal sums of the rows. For time 
of year and location we calculated Euclidean distances with unnormalized number of days and 
distance in meters between network pairs, respectively. To account for a weak seasonality effect 
of species richness and abundance, we used periodic instead of a linear temporal distance 
between networks fitted to an annual cycle. That is, the maximum temporal distance between 
two networks was 182 days. 
A.5 Model fit and analysis quality 
We employed goodness-of-fit indices using discrepancy functions, comparisons with null 
models, and information theory to assess model fit, including chi-square tests (compared to 
hypothesized and null model), adjusted goodness-of-fit index, root mean square error of 
approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis non-normed fit index (NNFI), Bentler-Bonnett normed 
fit index (NFI), Bentler comparative fit index (CFI) and standardized root mean square residual 
(SRMR). Index criteria, model fit thresholds, and index values for all three models are 
summarized in Table A6. 
Using a correlation matrix in structural equation modelling instead of a covariance matrix 
can result in incorrect standard errors of the coefficients as they fail to take account of sampling 

37 
variance in the standard deviations (Cudeck 1989, Grace 2006). Given the large sample size of 
our data sets and the normalized dissimilarity matrices, however, we believe that any potential 
inaccuracy in the calculation of the standard errors is of little biological relevance. The author of 
the sem library in R provided specific examples on building structural equation models on 
correlation matrices (Duncan et al. 1968 in manual to the R library ‘sem’, Fox 2012) and 
confirmed the use of Wald tests as appropriate tools to determine the statistical significance of 
model coefficients (J. Fox, pers. comm.). Further, to verify the results of our path analysis in R, 
we ran the same full model with Reticular Action Model or Near Approximation (RAMONA) 
implemented in the statistical package SYSTAT 12. Both sem and RAMONA use reticular 
action model notation (McArdle and McDonald 1984). RAMONA, however, accounts for the 
correlation matrix when fitting path analysis models and thereby avoids the potential errors 
associated to path analysis that treat a correlation matrix as if it were a covariance matrix. The 
results of the RAMONA model were comparable to those generated in R, suggesting that the 
influence of the correlation matrix on the standard errors of the coefficients was negligible. 
The correlation between floral composition and floral complexity was non-linear and 
showed a triangular pattern (Fig. A2). The pattern arises because networks that are similar in 
floral trait composition can be similar or dissimilar in plant species composition, networks that 
are very dissimilar in flower trait composition can only be dissimilar in plant species 
composition. To address this constraint, we developed a null-model to calculate Spearman 
correlation coefficients .... of randomly generated data (999 iterations) that were restricted by the 
limits of the observed data (the R code of the null model is provided as a Supplement). We 
evaluated the statistical significance of ..¯.. 
by calculating its 97.5% confidence intervals. To test 
the effect of the randomised ..¯.. 
on our SEM, we fixed the path between floral composition and 
floral complexity to ..¯.. 
(Fox 2006) and compared this model, following the model simplification 
procedure described above, to the model in which the path between floral composition and floral 
complexity is allowed to vary randomly (Shipley 2000). The model with the fixed parameter had 
a significantly worse model fit (.BIC = 13.9; likelihood ratio test: .2 = 20.9, P . 0.0001); we 
thus present here results on the original model with free parameter estimates only.

similarities in pollinator community 
composition as pollinators respond 
directly to changes in floral resources 
offered in the community.

Interaction pattern Floral community composition 
determines the type, amount and 
accessibility of resources in a 
community, thereby directly regulating 
the distribution and frequency of 
interactions in a network. We expect 
that similarity in floral composition 
between networks entails similarity in 
interaction pattern between networks.
