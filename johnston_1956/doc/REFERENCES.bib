 abstract = {The Short-eared Owl is a common winter visitant to the salt marshes around San Francisco Bay. Between four and ten owls live in the winter on the study plot of some 200 acres on San Pablo salt marsh. The owls forage mainly at night there. Of 638 items found in pellets, 75 per cent were mammals, 20 per cent birds, and 5 per cent insects. Mammals were responsible for about 90 per cent of the mass consumed, Microtus and Rattus being the most important kinds. The relationship of Short-eared Owl predation to the community food web is indicated by means of a diagram.},
